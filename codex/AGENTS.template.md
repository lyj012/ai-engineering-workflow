# Codex Adapter Guidance (AGENTS.md template)

This template is for a local OpenAI Codex `AGENTS.md` (Desktop or CLI). Generate the real `AGENTS.md` at the
target project root from this template; **keep the generated `AGENTS.md` out of git** — this public
repository tracks only the template. It consumes the platform-neutral contracts in `../core/` and must
**not** fork the engineering methodology into a second independent copy. Full stage contracts: `pipeline.md`.

## Scope

The complete closed loop, identical in rules/artifacts/statuses to the Claude workflow:
requirement → code-base analysis → plan → coding → tests → independent review → fix → independent verify →
diff → **customer git-choice** → commit → push.

Build it up in verified order: do not claim a stage runnable in Codex until a real `codex exec` run has
produced its artifacts and `node scripts/validate-plan-artifacts.mjs <dir>` + `node scripts/self-check.mjs`
pass. `plan-from-requirement` (read-only) is the safe first target; `deliver-from-plan` (sandbox) and
`publish-delivery` (git) follow.

## Execution Rules

- One Codex invocation per stage; pass JSON files between stages in a timestamped run directory.
- Use `codex exec` **only** for model work: requirement understanding, code analysis, implementation
  planning, risk identification, test planning, coding, independent review, fixing, independent verification.
- Use plain Node for **all** deterministic work — never ask the model to do bookkeeping:
  - decisions: `node bin/core.mjs <readiness|deliver-status|publish-status|persist-outcome|repo-fingerprint|project-type|git-guard|branch-choice> '<json>'`
  - git facts (read-only): `node bin/git-state.mjs --cwd <repo> [--mode <m>] [--target-branch <b>]`
  - validation: `node scripts/validate-plan-artifacts.mjs <dir>`; integrity: `node scripts/self-check.mjs`
- Keep Claude-specific `Workflow`, `phase()`, `agent()`, and resume semantics out of Codex prompts.
- Keep Codex-specific CLI flags and sandbox behavior out of `core/`.
- `plan-from-requirement` and `deliver-from-plan` never modify the target repository (deliver works in a
  sandbox copy and stops at a verified `changes.diff`).

## Customer Git-Choice Gate (publish stage — mandatory)

Before ANY branch op / commit / push:
1. Run `node bin/git-state.mjs --cwd <target> --mode <customer choice if any> --target-branch <name if any>`.
2. If the result's `branchChoice.needsChoice` is true → **stop and ask the customer**, offering **only** the
   options where `available` is true (never show an invalid one, never auto-pick). Treat this as
   `PUBLISH_NEEDS_CHOICE`; do not checkout, branch, commit, or push.
3. Strategies (offered only when valid in the current repo / worktree / HEAD state):
   `new-branch` (cut from current commit) · `switch-existing` (checkout a customer-named existing branch,
   needs `targetBranch`) · `current-branch` (commit on the current branch directly).

## Safety (unchanged across adapters)

Never `git push --force`/`-f`; never delete a remote branch or rewrite history (run every git command past
`node bin/core.mjs git-guard` first). Never stage `.env`/keys/`*.pem`/personal config. Protected branches
(main/master/release) require explicit opt-in. High-risk domains (payment/permission/secret/auth/
irreversible) hit a human gate. Block any change outside the planned SCOPE.

## Non-Goals

- No Cursor, Gemini, or generic adapter scaffolding. No UI.
- No duplicated schema/status/decision logic when `core/` already owns the contract — call `bin/`/`core/`.

## Capability Notes (verify before claiming runnable)

The design assumes public Codex support for a root `AGENTS.md` and non-interactive `codex exec`. Mark any
exact command line, `--output-schema`/JSON output mode, or sandbox flag as **verified only after a local
Codex run exercises it** in a real target repository. The deterministic surface (`bin/`, `scripts/`,
`core/`) is plain Node and already verified in this repository.
